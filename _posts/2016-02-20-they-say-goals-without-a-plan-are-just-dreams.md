Entry 1 -

> **They say goals without a plan are just dreams.**

About ten years ago, as I was imagining the course of my
life and setting up milestones for where I wanted to go with this adventure, I
told myself that by age 30, I wanted to have accomplished something meaningful
for myself, something useful for the world. 

The measure of success of that milestone was that by age 30,
I wanted to be a millionaire. I was just throwing these numbers out there
because I figured it would make it easier for me to focus. Know where I'm going
and how much energy I need to put in it.

Well I can tell you that I'm almost exactly 6 months away
from my deadline, and I have graciously procrastinated and found a lot of
excuses to not even be 10% into my goal. Sad, right? No. I refuse to be a
quitter. The stubborn mind I inherited tells me that I have to turn this dream
into a goal and make it happen.

I'm not trying to be delusional here. I don't think I can be
a millionaire in 6 months when I don't even have 20,000$ in cash to speak for.
Things might have not unraveled for me the way I imagined they would but I am
going to challenge myself like I know how to. If life surprises me with a
million dollars, then I'll just move on to my next goal: Make it worth a
billion in the life of a million.

Starting today, I need to put some order back into my life.
I think the first rule to start procrastinating is to take a first step. I need
SMART goals: specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and time bound
objectives. I am going to pursue my top 3 dreams before this third decade of my
life finds me. And if I leave before I get there, at least I would have died
trying.

**Goals:**

1\. Get my home organised inside out: I want to know
where everything I own is in this house, in my head, in my accounts, in my
electronic devices.

2\. Get my hair business rolling again: Beauté O is
the African business the modern black woman needs.

3\. Get my
African accessory business up and running and get help to maintain it.

I am only one person with 6 months to work with a home to
maintain. I'm already busy but I can do it.

I feel relieved already now that I've put this in writing.
Next step. Plan what all this means. Scope it. Determine what successful
completion will entail.
